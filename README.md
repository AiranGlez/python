## GETTING STARTED

### Functions

    A function is a block of code that works as a unit to do a specific task. Python functions can return values and can have parameters or arguments. Functions are also called 'methods' when it is defined inside a class.

Syntax:

```
def function_name():
    function instrunction1
    function instrunction2
    function instrunction3
    return (optional)
```

### Lists

    Lists are data structures that can store multiple items in a single variable. In Python, lists can store different types of values, and they can be dinamically expanded adding new elements. 

Syntax:

```
listName = [element1, element2, element3]
```

### Tuples

    Tuples are immutable lists, they cannot be modified. They are faster and lighter than lists, and can be used as keys in a dictionary.

Syntax:

```
tupleName = (element1, element2, element3)
```

### Dictionaries

    Dictionaries or associative arrays are data structures consisting of a collection of key-value pairs.

Syntax:

```
dictionaryName = {
    'name': 'myname'
    'age': 'myage'
    'id': 'myid'
}
```

### Conditionals: if

Syntax:

```
if condition:
    expression
elif condition:
    expression
else:
    expression
```

### Generators

    Generators are structures that allow you to declare a function that behaves like an iterator. They are more efficient than normal functions, useful with lists with infinite values.

[Check this](/demos/basics/generators.py) 

### Exceptions

    Exceptions are errors ocurring during programm execution. Code syntax is correct but the programm does not work as expected.
